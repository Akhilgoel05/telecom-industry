AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

In response to a noticeable decling of the revenue after the lauch of 5G services, a dashboard is created to dive down all the metrics present in the dataset aims to provide insights that will enable informed decision-making to boost the active user rate and other crucial metrics.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 & 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
After 5G our Revenue and Active users have been decreased but unsubscribed and Average Revenue per User has been increased which is a clear indication that the prices of our plan are increased and which is not liked by most of the users so they are unsubscribing mostly. So we must find a better price point for our plans.

Plan PI,P2,P3,P11 contributes majority of our Plan revenue and PI 1 is our best plan till date it has ranked 1 before and after 5G. Comapny must launch more plans like P1 and P11 keeping in mind the price factor point to increase our active users and to attract new users as well.
